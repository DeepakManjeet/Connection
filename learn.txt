$ git push
fatal: The current branch PrabhuWS has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin PrabhuWS

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
